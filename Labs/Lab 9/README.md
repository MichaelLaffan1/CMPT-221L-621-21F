# Lab 9

We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

<!-- After all my website coding is done, I would focus on getting a domain name for my website.
In terms of getting a domain name, I would go with Heroku, since it is free and I don't mind having
the name heroku in my website url. Next I would use Docker to deploy the website and get the website online. -->
